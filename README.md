# Sorting Algorithms and Big O notation
## By [Farah Mccurdy](https://github.com/farahmc) and Matthew Brinkmann
This is a project about understanding different sorting algorithms and how they can be explained with big 'O' notation.
### About the project
General
```
 ðŸ“„ The header file for the project is sort.h wil be required to compile locally
```
Each task contains the following
```
 ðŸ“„ The C code containing the algorithm, the naming is (task number)-[Algorithm Name].c
 ðŸ“„ Thebig O notation for the time complexity for that algorithm, the naming is (task number)-O
```
